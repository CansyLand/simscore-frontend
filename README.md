## Development - Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

npm install
# or

# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
